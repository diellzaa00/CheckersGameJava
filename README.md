# CheckersGameJava
In this project, I created a console-based Checkers game using Java.
The game allows two players to compete against each other by making moves and capturing opponent's pieces following the rules of Checkers. 
The game logic was implemented entirely through the console interface, enabling players to input their moves and view the board state without the need for a graphical user interface.
Through this project, I aimed to provide an enjoyable and interactive Checkers gaming experience purely through the console environment.
